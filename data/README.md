Preprocessed Datasets 

This folder contains structured healthcare datasets designed for AI, ML model training, and predictive analytics. The datasets support interoperability, cost estimation, and data-driven insights in the healthcare domain.  

Overview 

Source: Extracted from real-world claims, reimbursement data, and electronic health records (EHR).  
Processing: Cleaned, structured, and optimized for AI/ML pipelines and analytics.  
Formats Included: JSON, YAML, CSV, XML (FHIR, HL7 v3, DICOM metadata). 

Details 

ed_analytics_data.json → Emergency department analytics data in structured JSON format for AI-driven insights.  
adam.csv → Analyzed clinical data and financial transactions for hospital cost estimation.  
ed_analytics_data_ccd.xml → HL7 CDA Continuity of Care Document (CCD) containing structured emergency department patient records.
hl7_v3.xml → HL7 v3-formatted patient records for healthcare interoperability and messaging. patient_tracking_data_hl7_v3.xml → Structured patient flow tracking data using HL7 v3 messaging standards.
