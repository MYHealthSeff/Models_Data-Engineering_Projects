Models and Data Engineering Projects  

This repository showcases advanced data engineering, machine learning, and AI-driven data processing projects. It includes real-world datasets, high-performance scripts, and deployed models covering key domains such as healthcare analytics, pricing transparency, natural language processing (NLP), and AI integration.  

Key Features  
Comprehensive data pipelines: Preprocessing, cleaning, and mapping of structured datasets.  
Machine learning and AI integration: Model training, optimization, and CoreML deployment.  
API and interoperability: Fetching and processing real-time data from APIs and healthcare data standards (FHIR, HL7, ICD-10).  
Big data and cloud technologies: Workflows for handling large-scale data in distributed environments.
